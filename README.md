paper-theme
===
This is a fully functional proposal for a new basis for `paper-styles`

The MD side
---
The current `paper-styles` is a poor reflection of the color section of the Material Design spec and lacks a lot of
 necessary variables. This proposal implements the following variables

| Base variable | MD justification | Description |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `primary-color`, `primary-color-light`, `primary-color-dark`, `accent-color` | [Choose your palette](http://www.google.be/design/spec/style/color.html#color-ui-color-application) |  |
